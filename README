A few thrown together python functions to rename tv shows.
Nothing tricky although slightly overcomplicated in places.

parseHTML() - This function pulls in the html from episode guides on tvrage
and parses the episodes out into a txt file. 

simple_rename() - This function removes excess data from filenames and renames
everything to a simple clean format in the format episode.name.SXX.EXX.ext
This can be run in simulation mode that will print the result of running the function
without renaming any files.


title_rename() - This functions matches the show names in the text file from parseHTML
and the new show names from simple_rename and renames the files accordingly. This can be
run in simulation mode that will print the result of running the function without renaming
any files.

TODO:

Add warning/error messages if the number of files in a directory don't match the number
of episodes in a season

Choose a better format for the output of parseHTML()

Write better comments/docstrings in code.
